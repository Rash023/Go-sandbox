# go-sandbox

This repository is a sandbox environment for learning and experimenting with Go (Golang). It contains various code snippets, exercises, and projects that I worked on while starting my journey with the Go programming language.

## Contents

- **Basics**: Simple programs and examples to get familiar with Go syntax and concepts.
- **Exercises**: Practice problems and solutions to solidify understanding.
- **Projects**: Small projects to apply learned skills in real-world scenarios.
- **Notes**: Personal notes and observations made while learning.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a safe space for coding practice and experimentation. It serves as a personal reference and a record of my progress in learning Go.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the code, run the programs, and modify them to suit your learning needs. This is an open and evolving resource, so contributions and improvements are always welcome.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-sandbox.git
   cd go-sandbox
   ```

2. **Install Go**:
   Follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go on your machine.

3. **Run a sample program**:
   Navigate to one of the directories (e.g., `basics/`) and run a Go program:
   ```sh
   go run filename.go
   ```
